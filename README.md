Data Analysis Project: Physiological Data Analysis


Project Overview

This project performs data analysis on physiological data, such as blood pressure, age distributions, hemoglobin levels, and blood sugar levels. It includes:

- A Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis with visualizations.

- A Python script for users who prefer or need to run the analysis in a non-notebook environment.

File Structure

- physiological data-analysis.ipynb:
  - The main notebook file for interactive exploration and analysis.
  - Includes styled visualizations, tables, and in-line results.
  - Recommended for users who wish to explore or modify the analysis interactively.
physiological data-analysis.py:
The script version of the notebook.
Contains the same analysis logic, but without the inline outputs or Markdown explanations.
Ideal for running the analysis as a script in any Python environment.
